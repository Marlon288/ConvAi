2 Indroduction
Step by step, we will explain how we can enter the different levels of the Stadler technicians in
SMRS. If the technician books his hours, this is also immediately visible on the order. We are then
able to see and show that the correct qualified technician(s) have worked on an order.
Work  Work order  BOOK LABOR
Qualified staff are people who, due to their training, experience and/or instructions and knowledge
of relevant standards, legislation, provisions, accident prevention and working conditions, have
been declared competent by the unit’s safety officer to perform the required work and thus
recognise and prevent possible hazards.
The qualifications of employees are categorised according to DIN EN 13306 as follows:
Definition
L1 Simple measures, low education, instruction, no specific procedure.
L2 Basic measures, qualified staff, training, detailed procedure.
L3 Complex measures, qualified technical staff, detailed procedure.
L4
Measures with specific technical knowledge, specialist staff, detailed procedure, specific
professional expertise.
L5
Measures with specific knowledge or factory knowledge, specialist workshop of
manufacturer, detailed procedure, expert competence.
The level of the technicians is indicated in the field “Trade”. This field is also visible if the
technician books his hours on the work order. (See above in the SMRS print)
It is very important to understand the difference between the below wording:
Trade: This is the overall Level of the technician (L1 until L5)
Qualification: this is the training / competence that belongs to the trade level L1 until L5.

3 Setting up the competence that belongs to each level L1 until L5
To do this, we must define which qualifications a technician must have to fit into the L1 till L5
Trade category.
We have in SRS locations that have an complete training and examination plan and locations that
does not have this kind of detailed training plans.
An Location Manager or trainer must determine in all cases what Trade a technician belongs. This
can be done by the pasts education but also by experience of the employee.
Local (legal) requirements can demand that all safety related maintenance tasks have specific
training and examination, in that case all these training must be added to SMRS and categorized
under the trade level L1 till L5. Locations with this kind of systems have an dedicated training plan,
discuss with the local training responsible how to set up the categories that belongs under the
correct trade.
Example 1, location with internal training program.
In Nieuwegein we used training matrix (All the grey lines) for that:
An apprentice technician has an technical education, this is the basis level.
L1MBO3ME Intermediate vocational training (MBO) level 3 or comparable
L1MBO4ME Intermediate vocational training (MBO) level 4 or comparable
L1 is the L1 off the DIN EN13306.
MBO is the type off school where the technician has followed his technical education.
O3 and O4 are the different levels in which you can graduate.
L1 SIG EM 01 Apprentice technician SIG electrical/mechanical.
This technician can only perform easy tasks and is under supervision of an trainer.
The L1 technician follows a number of courses to become a maintenance technician. This can be
different for each location. It depends on the type of equipment that is being maintained. In
Nieuwegein we have a tram called SIG.
L2SIG O1 Disassembly and assembly of bogies
L2SIG O2 Disassembly and assembly of carrying bogies
L2SIG O3 Overhaul of engine and carrying bogies
L2SIG O4 Preventative maintenance training
L2 is the L2 off the DIN EN13306.
SIG is the type of vehicle.
O1 – O4 are the different courses and training.
if the technician has followed all the L2 courses he is a maintenance technician for the SIG tram.
In that way he can perform all maintenance task without supervision.
L2 SIG EM 01 Maintenance technician SIG electrical/mechanical
L2 SIG MED01 Maintenance technician SIG electrical/mechanical + Operator of the turning
machine

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
The maintenance technician has the opportunity to grow to a higher level technician. This are the
more safety related tasks. For this he has to follow different courses that brings him at the level L3.
See below example.
L3SIG 01 Chassis according to BE OH group 1
L3SIG 02 Automatic mechanical coupling according to BE OH group 3
L3SIG 03 Automatic electrical coupling according to BE OH group 3
L3SIG 04 Mechanical doors and windows according to BE OH group 5
L3SIG 05 Mechanical bogies and wheelsets according to BE OH group 6
L3SIG 06 Electrical bogies and wheelsets according to BE OH group 6
L3SIG 07 Sandblaster according to BE OH group 7
L3SIG 08 Compressor and air dryer according to BE OH group 7
L3SIG 09 Mechanical and electrical pantograph according to BE OH group 10
L3SIG 10 Cab lighting, carriage heating and air conditioning according to BE OH group 1
L3SIG 11 Communication equipment according to BE OH group 14
L3SIG 12 Electrical components according to BE OH group 15
L3SIG 13 Traction engines according to BE OH group 16
L3SIG 14 Motor generator according to BE OH group 17
L3SIG 15 Equipment, relay boxes and switchgear according to BE OH group 20
L3SIG 16 Earthing and return current according to BE OH group 21
L3 is the L3 off the DIN EN13306.
SIG is the type of vehicle.
O1 – O16 are the different courses and training.
If he has successfully completed it, he will be a fault technician for the vehicle in question.
L3 SIG ME 01 Fault technician SIG electrical/mechanical level 01
L3 SIG MED01 Fault technician SIG electrical/mechanical + Operator of the turning machine.
Example 2, Location without specific internal training program
In this example the location Manger is responsible to determine in what trade an employee has to
be added, the way how this is done has to be described to avoid discussion. Below an basic
example is given:
- An technician that works less than 1 year in the location and only performs light tasks is L1.
- An technician that has 2 year experience and received on the job training is L2.
- An technician with more than 2 year experience that has received dedicated trainings from
suppliers is L3.
- An technician that is allowed to work on safety related task by training is L4.
- IBS technicians / shift leaders / team leaders with specific training and responsibility
(allowed to release the train after service) are L5.

Please remind that specific trainings that are legally required should be added as category under
the trade at least for L3 until L5.
General comment:
The newer Stadler IHHB’S indicate under each maintenance task the applicable trade.
This will give an good indication how to determine the level of an employee.

7 Controlling the competences in SMRS
To check this data, the SMRS support team in SRS CH can create a report. This report must show
the qualifications of each employee, and must warn at the appropriate time when a certificate or
diploma expires.
There are several qualifications for each employee. These must therefore all be shown in the list. It
seems useful that the report should contain a number of selection criteria.
1. In organisation
2. Qualified
3. Warning (If validity is for longer than 3 months and there is no warning, then do not show a
warning.)
The report will be sent to the responsible employee each month.

1 Introduction
PM Schedules (plans fort he preventive maintenance) are used to display the preventive
maintenance in the Stadler Rail Maintenance Software (SRMS).
This document describes how to deal with PM Schedules in the SRMS. In particular, the setting up
of PM Schedules and their properties, the nesting with other PM Schedules, the release of PM
Work Orders (PM-WO) and their completion are described with examples.
System paths from the SRMS are displayed in green and tabs are marked YELLOW.

2 Set up PM Schedules
2.1 Record View
Work  WO Planning  PM Schedules RECORD VIEW
The general properties of the PM Schedules are defined here.
PM Schedule: Specify a unique code and description fort he PM Schedule
Type: There are three types of PM Schedules, the difference between these is, how the maturity of
the next PM Work order is calculated and how many PM Work Orders that can be shared at the
same time:
Type Berechnung der Fälligkeit At the same time released
WO
Duplicate Original maturity of the last WO + interval several
Fixed Original maturity of the last WO + interval one
Variabel Completion of the last WO + interval one
Perform Every [UoM]: Time interval oft he PM Schedule, including unit of measure (e.g.,
performing every 2 months)
Meter Interval [UoM]: Meter interval of the PM Schedule, including unit of measure (e.g., 30,000
km, 500 h, etc.)
Nesting Reference: Reference for nesting PM Schedules. PM Schedules with the same nesting
reference are interleaved. (For more details see chapter 3.)
Nest Buff. (- / +): Percentage for the calculation of the nesting of PM Schedules. (For more details
see chapter 3.)

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
Complete Status: Status which contains subordinate, already released PM Work Orders, when
they are suppressed by nesting. (For more details see chapter 3 & 4.)
WO Type: Type of the PM Work Order generated from the PM Schedule (Default: Preventive
Maintenance)
Duration: Duration (in days) of the PM Work Order, which is used to calculate the planned end
date. (Planned end date = due date (= scheduled start date) + duration)
Priority: Priority of the PM Work Order (default: blank)
2.2 Activities
Work  WO Planning  PM Schedules  ACTIVITIES
With this step, the activities are added tot he PM Schedule. After the approval of the PM Work
Orders, the activities are added in the work order.
Activity: Numbering of activities. (e.g., 10, 20, 30, ... or predefined task numbers.)
Trade: Indication of the predefined profession. Can also be used to distinguish between activities
be used. (e.g., MAINT (general maintenance engineer) or CLEAN (cleaning), CHECK (check),
ADMIN (administration), ...)
Task Plan: Specification of predefined task for activity (e.g., task from maintenance manual.)
Material List: Indication of predefined material list to the activity (e.g., filter mats, transmission oil,
brake pads, ...)

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
People Required: Required persons to complete the task.
Estimated Hours: Estimated hours of work. (Total of hours)
Start: Planned start date of the activity. Useful, if the PM Schedules has a duration of more then
one day.
1 = Start of the activity = self day as planned start date (WO)
2 = Start of activity = scheduled start date (WO) + 1
3 = Start of activity = scheduled start date (WO) + 2
etc.
Duration: Duration (in days) of the activity to calculate the planned end date of the activity.
(Planned end date = planned start date (activity) + duration.)
Average Booked Hours (Last 25 Work Orders): Automatically calculated value. Average from
the bookings of the last 25 WO. The value of the average hours can be transferred to the
"Estimated hours" field after an "experience" period.
2.3 Equipment
Work  WO Planning  PM Schedules  EQUIPMENT
In this step, equipment’s are added to the PM Schedule. For each equipment, own maturities are
calculated and own PM Work Orders are created. PM Schedules are defined in SRMS for whole
vehicles by default. However, it is also possible to define PM Schedules for subcomponents (e.g.,
bogies, compressors, etc.) separately.
If necessary, the interval data from the record view can be defined once again per equipment. The
entries in the equipment’s override those in the record view.

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
Equipment: Specification of the equipment to which the PM Schedule is applied.
Department: Automatic assignment depending on the equipment.
Location: Automatic assignment depending on the equipment.
Perform Every [UoM]: Time interval of PM Schedules for this equitment, including unit of measure
(for example, every 2 months).
Due Date: Due date of the next PM Work Order which is calculated by the system. The due date
must be entered manually.
Assigned To: Assignment of PM Work Orders to personnel
Meter Interval: Meter interval of the PM Schedule for this equipment, including unit of measure
(e.g., 30,000 km, 500 h, etc.)
Meter Due: By the system calculated meter due of the next PM Work Order. For creating a PM
schedule, the first meter due has to be entered manually.
2.4 Documents
Work  WO Planning  PM Schedules  DOCUMENTS
In this step, documents can be added to the PM. These are added automatically to the work orders
when releasing PM Work Orders, if „Copy to work order“ is selected. Ou can also select „Print with

3 Nesting with other PM Schedules
PM schedules can be nested hierarchically. This is useful to have parent PM Schedules (i.e., PM
schedules with higher intervals) that contain activities of child PM schedules (i.e., PM schedules
with lower intervals).
Nesting reference: All PM schedules with the same nesting reference (e.g., P, LDG, MDG) are
hierarchically nested.
Nest buffer:The Percentage for calculating the length of the buffer, depending on the execution
interval of the PM schedule. By default these values are set to - / + 50%.
Examples
Execute all Nest-
Buffer -

Buffer - Buffer +
1 Month (30 days) 50 50 15 days 15 days
3 Months (90 days) 50 50 45 days 45 days

500 h 50 50 250 h 250 h
30‘000 km 33 50 10‘000 km 15‘000 km
Usage of the Nest buffer:
The calculated nesting buffer is applied to the due date of the parent PM work order. If the due
date of the parent PM work order and the due date + / - buffers of the child PM work order
coincide, is the child PM work order going to be suppressed: " Due to bypassed Work order by
nesting".
Bypassed PM-Work Orders: The currently bypassed PM work orders can be displayed in the
report Work  Reports  Scheduling  List of WOs Bypassed due to Nesting.

Cost Codes
This document describes the process about how you should close a WO for breakdowns to make
sure that the field Cost Code is filled. You only have to do this process, if you change the
Equipment, which means you close it on a Child Equipment.
Possibilty 1. (Change the Equipment in the “Record View”)
1. Open the WO, which you have to fill. At the moment for the equipment is the whole vehicle
selected (1).
2. Change the equipment (2) now and you will see that the cost code has been deleted (3).

3. Now you have to enter the cost code and if you do not change the equipment again (4),
the cost code will not be deleted anymore (5). That means you can proceed with filling in all
the data and complete the WO at the end in the register “Closing” (6).
Possibilty 2. (Change the Equipment in the “Closing”)
1. You fill out the whole WO (Record View, Activities, Book Labor etc.)

2. You go to the tab “Closing”, select the correct child equipment (1) and enter the data. Make
sure that you do not change the status to “completed”.
3. Go back to the register Record View, enter the Cost Code again (2) and set the status to
Completed (3).
Summary
As soon as you change the Equipment, you have to fill in the Cost Code again because the system
overwrites it with a blank field.
Why is the system doing this
For values coming from the Equipment, the system will overwrite existing values even if the value
on the Equipment is NULL. In other words, if the value (Cost Code) on the Equipment is NULL (In
SRMS it is for every Equipment NULL), then the value on the WO will be set to NULL as well.

In particular the quick store to store transfer is used to move parts between two stores which are in the same
Organization or parts which are in the Organization *. In this Document the quick store to store transfer is
used to move parts between the two stores Marghera and Mestre (Container Depot).
To do the transfers, there is not much preparation needed. You must have a valid part data set, more than
one store in the organization and a quantity on stock which you want to transfer. If you want to transfer the
parts in the same store between bins, you have to use the action “Transfer Part between Bins”.

1 Introduction
This document describes the physical inventory of the Stadler Rail Maintenance Software (SRMS).
System paths from the SRMS are displayed in green and tabs are marked YELLOW.
E.g. Work  WO Planning  PM SCHEDULES
2 Performing a physical inventory
Performing a physical inventory involves physically counting the materials you have in store and
comparing the inventory data that you gather during count with the data stored in your online
inventory. The physical inventory process enables you to reconcile your online inventory with the
actual stock on the shelves and in bins in your stores. This practice is commonly referred to as a
cycle count.
After you finish the physical count, you can enter the actual physical quantities found in your cycle
count. If you find that there are discrepancies between the Expected Qty. and the Physical Qty.
of inventory items, you can reconcile all of the inventory discrepancies, and then approve the
physical inventory record.
3 Generating a physical inventory counting sheet
Materials  Transcations  Physical Inventory
Generate a physical inventory counting sheet to create a snapshot of the data in your online
inventory that you will use to compare with the data you gather during your cycle count. Creating a
physical inventory enables you to specify the store and inventory parameters that identify the
materials for which you will perform your cycle count.
Specify inventory parameters as necessary to generate a more narrow or specific list of part data
captured by the physical inventory snapshot. You can also specify a Physical Inventory Date. If
you specify a date, the system only includes items in the physical inventory that have been
specified into stock prior to the date specified.
Note: You can also specify wildcards for the Part, Part Class, Stock Class, From Bin, and To
Bin inventory parameters as necessary to generate data. If you know all but one character, you
can specify the characters you know, and substitute _ for the unknown character. If you only know
a portion, you can specify the portion of the parameter that you know, and substitute % for the
remaining portion. For example, if you specify P% for Part, the system retrieves all parts that begin
with the letter "P." If you specify %PIP% for Part, the system retrieves all parts with codes that
include the letters "PIP."
When you generate a physical inventory record, the system only saves the snapshot of your online
inventory data generated by the physical inventory. It does not save the parameters you specify.
You must specify the parameters upon which to base generation of a physical inventory record
each time you want to generate a physical inventory record.
After you physically count your inventory, you can update your online inventory data on the Parts
page of the Physical Inventory form to reconcile any discrepancies in your physical and online
Seite 4/7
Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
inventory. After reconciling any differences in your inventory data, you can update the status and/or
approve the physical inventory based on your status change authorization privileges. However, the
system enables and/or protects the fields available for update based on the status from which you
are updating the physical inventory. Status changes for physical inventory Status change
authorizations are set up for the TRAN entity on the Status Authorizations form.
If you create a physical inventory record and are unable to perform the actual cycle count
immediately, the system also enables you to refresh an existing physical inventory to update the
expected quantities in the physical inventory data snapshot.
To generate a physical inventory counting sheet:
1. Open Materials  Transcations  Physical Inventory
2. Click New Record
3. Specify this information:
Store
Select the store for which to create the physical inventory.
Physical Inventory
Specify a description of the physical inventory in the adjacent field. The system assigns a
physical inventory number after you save the record. The system automatically populates
Created By and Date Created.
Status
Select the status. The system automatically assigns Unfinished status to the physical
inventory, or the equivalent user code status.
Note: If the SDATE installation parameter is set to YES, the system updates the
Physical Inventory Date to the current date when the status of the physical inventory
is set to Approved.
Part
Specify the part for which to create the physical inventory.
Part Class
Specify the part class for which to create the physical inventory.
Stock Class
Specify the stock for which to create the physical inventory.
ABC Class
Select the ABC class for which to create the physical inventory.
Include Consignment Item(s)
Select to include stock records for consignment items, or items in stock that haven't been
paid for, in the physical inventory.
From Bin
Specify the bin from which to create the physical inventory.
Seite 5/7
Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
To Bin
Specify the bin to which to create the physical inventory.
Note: Use From Bin and To Bin to indicate a bin range for which to create a
physical inventory for numbered bins. For example if you have numbered your bins
consecutively, such as 001, 002, 003, 004, 005, and you want to create a physical
inventory taken from the inventory contained in bins 001 through 005, specify 001
for From Bin and 005 for To Bin to capture a physical inventory for the stock
contained in bins 001 through 005.
Physical Inventory Date
Specify the reference date for the physical inventory. If you specify a date, the system
selects only those parts whose Stock Date (the date the part is specified into stock) is
before the date specified for Physical Inventory Date.
Include Child Store(s)
Select to include stock records for all child stores of the selected Store in the physical
inventory.
Include Out of Service Item(s)
Select to include stock records for out of service parts in the physical inventory.
4. Click Save Record
Note: After generating the physical inventory and printing the counting sheet,
transactions such as issues, returns, and receipts may occur before the database is
updated. To update the expected quantities to reflect the current levels in the
database, you can select a physical inventory record to update, right-click on the
form, and then select Refresh Inventory. The system updates the expected
quantity of the parts on the physical inventory record on the Parts tab of the
Physical Inventory forms to the current levels. However, you can only refresh the
physical inventory if the Status is Unfinished.
4 Entering physical inventory quantities in SRMS
Enter physical inventory quantities to update the actual physical quantities of inventory items found
during your cycle count. You can only enter physical inventory quantities for physical inventory
records with the status unfinished.
The setting of the STTKDISC installation parameters determines the manner in which the system
handles discrepancies between the expected quantities and physical quantities of parts tracked by
asset.
Note: Regardless of the setting of the STTKDISC installation parameter, the system cannot
update the stock level for a part tracked by asset for which there is a discrepancy because
parts tracked by asset are tracked individually and their movements and quantities must be
accurately recorded.

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
To enter physical inventory quantities:
1. Materials  Transcations  Physical Inventory
2. Now create a new record ( )
3. Now select the store (1) for which a correction of the amount of parts has to be made. Here
it must be ensured that a description (2) of the inventory is made.
4. Now you can either choose the part (3) for which the "Amount of parts" should be
corrected, the "Stock" or the "Bin" (4).
5. We take for this example the part "main transformer" (12000799).
6. After the parts selection, click on the "Parts" tab (5) in which the previously selected part
should be visible.
7. 7. In the tab "Parts" (6), select the part (7) and enter the correct number of parts in the
"Inventory quantity" field (8)
8. 8. Click Save Record (9).
9. After saving, switch to the tab "Record view" (10) and change the status (11) from
"Unfinished" to "Approved" (12). Save the record again (13). Now the stock of the
corresponding spare part is adjusted.

5 Refreshing existing physical inventory data
Refresh existing physical inventory data to update the expected quantities in the physical inventory
data snapshot as necessary. Refreshing existing physical inventory data enables you to update an
existing physical inventory if you have been unable to perform the actual cycle count for some time
following creating the physical inventory record. You can only refresh physical inventory data for
records with unfinished status.
After refreshing existing physical inventory data, you can view the updated expected quantities for
the physical inventory on the Parts page.
To refresh existing physical inventory data:

1 Einführung
This document describes the Tool Management of the Stadler Rail Maintenance Software (SRMS).
Tools can be kept as parts in the store, booked on work orders and also defined as assets.
System paths from the SRMS are displayed in green and tabs are marked YELLOW.

2 Basics
Tools are Equipment that is used to perform maintenance work, such as B. torque wrench or a drill.
The department is usually the "owner" of a tool, which means that the department's store manages
the tool.
For each tool type has to be considered, how it should be displayed in the system.
 Only as Tool type
 As Tool type and part
 As Tool type and part with a linked assed (Serial number)
The following table helps to find the best method of defining the tool:
Tool Type Wichtigkeit für die Organisation Definiere das
Werkzeug als ...
Hammer Low - tool can be easily and inexpensively replaced Simple Tool
Ratchet Medium - tool must be ordered and on stock Tool and Part
Torque
wrench
High - tool needs to be ordered, on stock and is valuable,
tool tracking is possible
Tool, Part and Asset
Depending on requirements, the necessary steps for defining the tools can now be carried out
according to the following chapters.

3 Set up tool
3.1 Define Tool types
Work  Setup  Tools
The register Tools should be used to define tool types.
"Tool" refers to a tool type, not on single equipment. If the organization has for example several
drills, a general tool code called DRILL should be created.
1. New record.
2. Tool –Enter a unique code to identify the tool type and then enter a description for the tool
type in the field on the right hand side.
E.g.:
Drill  Tool & Part
Hammer  Only Tool
Torque wrench  Tool, Part und Asset

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
3.2 Link Tools with Parts
If the tool is also carried as a part, then the tool must be created as a part and linked to a tool type
afterwards.
Thus, the tool can be used and monitored as a bearing part.
Procedure "Create parts", please consult manual material setup.
Materials  Parts
The required tools should be created as parts and linked to the tool type.
Beim Feld Werkzeug muss der zuvor erstellte Werkzeugtyp ausgewählt werden.
For the field Tool the previously created tool type must be selected.
If the tool or the part has also be managed as asset, then "tracked by Asset" must be selected
The tools (defined as parts) are all placed in the stock Tool Output (TOOL):

3.3 Link tool part with asset
If a tool also has to be linked as an asset (serial number tracked), a corresponding asset must be
created and linked to the tool part.
For details on how to create an asset, please consult document:
„SRMS_Doc_Link_Parts_Assets_V1_EN_V0.4_OK“
Der Drehmomentschlüssel wird als Betriebsmittel mit Status „im Lager“ angelegt und mit dem Teil
T-0001 (Drehmomentschlüssel [ 30 - 200 Nm ] verknüpft. Dazu wird die Seriennummer des
Drehmomentschlüssels eingegeben.
Somit wird nun dieses Werkzeug „Drehmomentschlüssel“ als Einzelstück mit Seriennummer
verfolgt.
The torque wrench is created as asset with status "in stock" and linked with the part
T-0001 (torque wrench [30 - 200 Nm]) by entering the serial number of the torque wrench.
Thus, now this tool "torque wrench" is tracked as a single piece with a serial number.
Now, a second, similar torque wrench can be linked as another asset with the same part

4 Use Tools
After the setup, tools can be scheduled and / or booked to work orders.
4.1 Werkzeuge Planen
WorkWork Orders  PLAN TOOLS
In der Registerkarte Werkzeuge planen können nun innerhalb eines offenen Arbeitsauftrages
Werkzeuge eingeplant werden.
In the tab plan tools, tools can now be scheduled within an open work order.
Now we plan to use a torque wrench in the work order 21405:
The tool type and the estimated period of use must be specified.
4.2 Tools Usage
A tool can now be booked to a work order.
The procedure is the same as for parts.
Work  Work Orders  PARTS
E.g. : Use of the torque wrench in the work order 21405:

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
Select Part Wrench Torque (30-200 nm), Transaction type Issue, enter Quantity.
Since this torque wrench is tracked by asset, the Asset ID must be specified and which torque
wrench is used. Thus, it can be traced at a later date, which specific torque wrench was used for
this work.
Now the record can be saved.
The tool is now booked on the Work Order ( WO ).
After work, the tool can be returned:
Therefore select the Part T-0001 ,switch the transaction type to return, Quantity 1 and select the
Tool Hours (How long the tool was used).

1 Introduction
This document describes the standardized internal repair process of the Stadler Rail Maintenance Software
(SRMS). In particular, the preparations / requirements for the repair process, as well as the process itself are
described. The repair process also distinguishes whether the part is repaired internally or whether the part is
given for external repair. This document describes only the internal process, the external process is
described in a separate document (SRMS_Doc_StandardizedProcessExternalRepair_V1_EN).
Note: Since SRMS version 11.0 a repairable part is described as "tracking cores". The reason for this is, that
a part can not only be repaired. It also can be exchanged for example by the manufacturer.

3 Preparation
3.1 Part repairable
Materials  Part  RECORD VIEW
Parts which have to be repaired must be marked as "Track Cores". Therefore you have to check the
checkbox which is marked red in the picture below.
3.2 Repair Details entered
Materials  Parts  REPAIR DETAILS
Repair details must be entered for each repairable part. The repair details must be maintained in order to be
able to go through the repair process as planned. The repair details are set per part and store.
3.2.1 Enter Repair Details for Internal Repair
It is important that you select internal repair and do not forget to choose a WO Equipment, otherwise the
repair process will not work because a WO for repairable cores can not be generated. Both fields are marked
red in the picture below.

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
3.3 Repair Equipment available
It is conceivable that not every repair part can be uniquely assigned to a equipment in the vehicle structure.
In order to be able to create later an internal repair work order, the "dummy system" internal repair is
created. Therefore follow the steps below.
Equipment  Systems RECORD VIEW
1. Click on the sign to add a new record
2. Select the organization (If it should be available for all locations choose “*”)
3. Define a unique system code
4. Define a description (in this example “Internal repair”)
5. Save the details by clicking on the sign
If you are not sure about how to enter the data properly, contact the SRMS team and they will support you.
This equipment should then be entered in Materials  Parts  REPAIR DETAILS under Internal Repair Details
in the field WO Equipment (See step 3.2.1).

4 Internal Repair Process described step by step
This chapter describes the internal repair process step by step. To describe the process the following part is
taken: “1051572 Documentation Part”
4.1 Preparation
As already mentioned, to do the internal repair process in the system, the part must be marked as “track
cores”, otherwise the process will not work
Materials  Parts  RECORD VIEW
After the part is marked as „track cores“, the repair Details needs to be added. Therefore switch to the
register “Repair Details”.
Materials  Parts  REPAIR DETAILS
In this step one of the possible stores has to be selected to enter the repair details. For this example, the
store MAGHERA has been taken. Furthermore it is important, that you select “Internal Repair”, fill in the WO
Equipment and if needed change the default core bin. For this Example the Equipment AA00030100 has
been taken but as already mentioned if you can not define it, take the “dummy System” Internal Repair. The
other fields can be added as additional information but do not affect the process.

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
At the moment there are two parts available on Stock and no Core Qty.
Materials  Parts  STOCK
The average price of this part is 100 EUR.
Materials  Parts  PRICES
There are two possibilities how a part can be removed, which will be described in the next steps.
4.2 Create or choose a Work Order
The part which has to be repaired needs to be removed. For this purpose, a work order with the necessary
information has to be generated manually via the “Call Center” or an already existing WO where you have to
repair some parts internally has to be selected. In this case a new WO has been created, which has the
number 131753 and the description “WO Documentation Internal Repair”.
Create the work order:
Work  Work Orders RECORD VIEW
Now switch to the tab Activities and enter a new activity. Therefore the fields Trade, People Required and
Estimated Hours have to be filled.

Work  Work Orders  ACTIVITIES
4.3 Remove part (return) for all parts (Variant 1)
Switch to the tab Parts in the WO and select the part which you want to return to stock as a “core return”.
Important: The checkbox “Core Return" must be selected an the “Transaction type” must be Return. The
steps which have do been done are described below in more detail.
Work Work Orders  PARTS
1. Add a new part, either via entering directly the part number or search it via the look up filter. In there
you can filter the parts by track cores, which means that you only see the repairable parts.
2. Select the store to which you want to return the part
3. Make sure that the transaction type is “return”

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
4. Choose the bin to where you want to return the part
5. Choose the transaction Qty.
6. Make sure, that the check box “Core Return” is selected.
7. Save the details by clicking on the sign
8. Repeat the steps from 1 to 7 as many times, until all parts are entered that have to be returned
9. This fields shows you the actual quantity which you have in the selected store
If you now check the stock, you will see that there is 1 quantity as “Core Quantity”. This is the part we have
returned as core return.

4.4 Remove or replace part (return) (Variant 2)
The variant 2 is for parts which are linked to an asset (serial number).
If a part that is “tracked by asset”, has to be removed or replaced, the process "Child Equipment
Replacement" can be used as well. You will find it in the SRMS in the follwong path.
Equipment  Process  Child Equipment Replacement
See the detailed instruction about this process in the documentation
"SRMS_Doc_Replace_ChildEquipment_Asset_V1_EN"
4.5 Installing / Issue „new“ part (output)
In this example, an available spare part is installed directly after removal of the defective part which has to
be repaired, but this step can be done at every step of the process, so it could be done either now or later in
the process.
In the work order (131753), the available spare part is reinstalled by selecting “issue“ and the correct bin.

4.6 Generate repair Work Order
If you repair parts internally, a repair WO needs to be generated. This is not the same WO as the WO which
was created in step 4.2. Therfore you have to follow the path below.
Work  Process  Generate WOs  PARAMETERS
By selecting the check box "Generate WOs for repairable cores" (1) and clicking on the "Process" button (2),
a preview of all repair orders for the parts in the store (repair details: internal repair) with a repair quantity (>
0) is displayed.
Work  Process  Generate WOs  PREVIEW
The actual work orders which have to be generated can be selected and generated by clicking on the
"Generate" button.
4.7 Carry out repair (Process Work Order)
You will find the generated WO of the step 4.6 in the list view of the WOs. In there you can set the filter for
the “Type” to “Repairable spare” and the “Status” to released to easily find the generated WO. The default
description of the WO is always “-“.

4.10 Complete process (close issue/return Work Order (131754))
The last step of the process is to close the work order (131753) where the part was issued and returned.
This step can also be done previous in the process, if you install a part from the store and not install the part
again which you have returned as a repair part and repaired internally. Additional activities and additional
hours can be booked in the WO but for this example we do not fill additional data, which means that the WO
can be closed and the status set to completed.
Work  Work Orders  RECORD VIEW
4.11 Summary
In this process there will always be at least two work orders, one where you Issue/Return the parts
and book the maintenance and one/many for the repair, where you book the hours and the material
you need to repair the parts.
Note: this work orders are not linked, but you can link it for example via the description field which
means that you type in in the repair work order the number of the original work order. In this example
it would be -> Repair WO Documentation (131753).

1 Introduction
This document describes the standardized external repair process of the Stadler Rail Maintenance Software
(SRMS). In particular, the preparations / requirements for the repair process, as well as the process itself are
described. The repair process also distinguishes whether the part is repaired internally or whether the part is
given for external repair. This document describes only the external process, the internal process is
described in a separate document (SRMS_Doc_StandardizedProcessInternalRepair_V1_EN).
Note: Since SRMS version 11.0 a repairable part is described as "tracking cores". The reason for this is, that
a part can not only be repaired. It also can be exchanged for example by the manufacturer.
System paths from the SRMS are marked green and the tabs are marked YELLOW in this documentation.

4 External Repair Process described step by step
This chapter describes the external repair process step by step. To describe the process the following part is
taken: “1051572 Documentation Part”
4.1 Preparation
As already mentioned, to do the external repair process in the system, the part must be marked as “track
cores”, otherwise the process will not work
Materials  Parts  RECORD VIEW
After the part is marked as „track cores“, the repair Details needs to be added. Therefore switch to the right
register.
Materials  Parts  REPAIR DETAILS
In this step one of the possible stores has to be selected to enter the repair details. For this example, the
store MAGHERA has been taken. Furthermore it is important, that you select “External Repair”, fill in the
preferred supplier and if needed change the default core bin. The other fields can be added as additional
information but do not affect the process.

At the moment there are two parts available on stock and no Core Qty.
Materials  Parts  STOCK
The average price of this part is 100 EUR.
Materials  Parts  PRICES
4.2 Create or choose a Work Order
In this case a new WO is generated from where the broken part is returned and to where a new part is
issued from the store. In addition to this, the services that have been ordered from the supplier are going to
be booked on this WO as well. The service could also be booked to a different WO but in this case they are
going to be booked in the same WO.
Work  Work Orders  RECORD VIEW
Now switch to the tab Activities and enter a new activity. Therefore the fields Trade, People Required,
Estimated Hours have to be filled. It is important, that you select Hired Labor for the activity which has to
be ordered from an external supplier.

4.4 Installing / Issue „new“ part (output)
In this example, an available spare part is installed directly after removal of the defective part which has to
be repaired, but this step can be done at every step of the process, so it could be done either now or later in
the process.
In the work order (131571), the available spare part is reinstalled by selecting “issue “ and the correct bin.

The parts contained in the purchase order are listed here. Details of individual parts of the purchase order
can be customized. As described before, the price of a part for external repair is always the avg. Price
which is currently in the system.
The next step is to add services to the PO. In this example the repair of the part costs 20 EUR, which means
we book a service for 20 EUR as a fixed price and link it to the correct WO activity.

By clicking on “Print Preview” or “Print record”, a purchase order can either be reviewed or printed.
The report now will not be correct, because it shows the Part line with a value of 100 EUR and the service
line with a value of 20 EUR which means in total 120 EUR but the actual ordered amount is just 20 EUR.
This will be fixed in the near future so that in the case of external repair, the PO report will not show the part
line.

Then the part line is imported and you can choose the Bin. There are two possibilities now, you can either
put it into a normal bin or create a new bin which is similar to the normal bin but has an “.R” at the end. If this
method is chosen, you can later on distinguish between new parts and repaired parts, but the price is for
both parts the same which is the avg. price of the part. If you want to have for every bin an “R” bin in the
system, you have to contact the SRMS Administrators and they will create it for you.
In this example the part is booked to the same Bin as the new part was taken from which is A1-2. After you
have added all the information, go to “actions” and approve the part which triggers the transaction.
On stock we will have now the same Qty. as we had at the beginning of the process.

The voucher total is now 120 EUR. This is 100 EUR to high, because the Original invoice from the supplier
shows only the costs for the services. In the SRMS we have to include the part price as well so that there is
no negative impact on the part price. To solve the problem of this “Over invoicing”, a Credit note has to be
linked to this invoice by the amount of the part price. This will be described in the next chapter.

1 Introduction
This document describes the handling of parts that are tracked by serial number and linked to
assets in the SRMS (Stadler Rail Maintenance Software). Further information on parts and assets
can be found in separate documents.
System paths from SRMS are marked green and tabs are marked YELLOW

2 Difference between Parts and Assets
2.1 Parts
A Part in the system is a record to store spare parts. Parts can be stored in stores, ordered in
orders, booked on work orders and have various information, etc. Parts do not have a specific
serial numbers for themselves.
2.2 Assets
An asset in the system is a record of particular components in the vehicle structure. Assets can be
exchanged between different vehicles, used as equipments for work orders, and have various
information, etc. Assets have specific serial numbers and should have linked to a part to store
them in a store.

3 Track Parts as Assets
Materials  Parts  RECORD VIEW
Parts that are tracked with serial numbers must be linked to an asset. This link is only possible if
the part has selected next to "Track by asset".
Parts can only be tracked by assets if they have an available amount of 0.
For parts that are tracked by assets, the stock quantity can not be adjusted manually.
Materials  Parts  STOCK
The tab "Stock" lists all the parts that are available in the store. No part ever has a value more than
one. If a part of the inventory is tracked by asset, each row has a specific asset ID for the
associated assets.

4 Link Parts with Assets
Equipment  Assets  RECORD VIEW
4.1 Installed Assets
Assets that have the status "Installed" which means they are installed in the vehicle, should have a
linked part. If this is not the case, the component replacement (see chapter 5) will not work
properly.
4.2 Assets in the store
For parts that are already stored in the store and new have to be tracked as assets, a new asset
must be created. The easiest way to create a new asset is to copy an existing one with the status
"Installed" and change the status to "In Store".
The number key of the new equipment must be changed as well.
xxxx P 000 z
xxxx = Object classes(e.g. 1601)
P = Spare Part
000 = no vehicle number
z = Numbering of the identical spare parts (1-9)
The fields "Part", "Store" and "Bin" are mandatory and must be filled out so that the asset is
booked to the store.

4.3 Assets „Waiting to purchase“
It is also possible to create new assets before the spare parts have been ordered or arrived in the
store. The process is the same as in Chapter 4.2 (copying an existing one with the status
"Installed" and changing the status).
The only difference is that in this case the status has to be changed to "Awaiting purchase".
The fields "Store" and "Bin" can not be filled in this case. These are automatically filled in at "goods
received".

5 Replacement of assets in the vehicle structure
There are two different possibilities to change the assets in the vehicle structure.
1. Sub-object exchange process - described in the corresponding document.
2. Return and output of parts directly in the work order - described in the corresponding
document.

Introduction
Inventory tracking is monitoring by using three methods:
 On demand (manual monitoring)
 Reorder Level (as soon as the reorder level is reached or undershot)
 Min/Max (as soon as the minimum quantity is reached, the quantity maximum is increased
to the maximum)
This is in the master data of materials (Materials  Parts  STORES) defined.
A material request is always created first by using the function "Generate Requisitions".
Menu paths from the SRMS turn green and the tabs YELLOW marked.

1. Inventory Tracking
1.1. Set up stock methods
The stock methods are defined under Materials  Parts  Stores. Every
Stock item which has to be monitored must be assigned to a stock method ("On Demand", "Min /
Max" or "Reorder level"). The quantities (reorder level, order quantity, minimum quantity and
maximum quantity) and a preferred supplier is needed.

1.2. Stock methods „On Demand“ , „Min/Max“ and „Reorder level“
Overview
When does a material requirement arise?
 From the stock method „Min/Max“
 From the stock method „Reorder level“
 Material reservations on work orders
This minimum stock monitoring or reordering monitoring is seen from the perspective of the
stock data record. With the determination of the warehouse and the preferred supplier, a
request is generated as soon as the system determines that the stock level falls below the
specified value.
Description Min/Max
The "Min / Max" method is chosen to maintain inventory based on a given minimum and
maximum amount of resources. When the quantity of a storage part reaches a level lower
than the specified minimum quantity, the system orders the required quantity of the part so
that the stock quantity rises again to the specified maximum quantity.
Reorder level and Order Quantity are read-only, when the stocking method is set to Min /
Max
First Example:
Stock method Min/Max
Minimum quantity : 5 pieces
Maximum quantity: 100 pieces
As soon as the available stock quantity drops below 5 pieces, this is recognized by the application
(Infor EAM) and at the next request compensates the difference to the specified maximum stock
quantity by a corresponding request (order).
(Stock 3, maximum quantity 100, purchase order 97)
Such a stocking request may include either a single part or the inventory of an entire warehouse,
depending on what has been defined.

Second Example:
Stock method Min/Max
Minimum quantity : 5 pieces
Maximum quantity: 100 pieces
Available stock quantity: 6 pieces
The system does not react because none oft he given parameters are affected, but when
reservations for parts are made in work orders (see lines below) requests are generated as well.
Reserved parts in work order: 2 pieces
The requisitons generation takes into account:
6 parts in stock  2 parts needed. The stock value falls under the minimum quantity of 5 parts.
This means that there are only 4 parts left in stock. This automatically triggers the request in the
Infor EAM application that the warehouse has to be increased to 100 units again. Thus, a request
(order) with the difference stock of 96 pieces is generated from the application.
Third example:
Stock method Min/Max
Minimum quantity : 5 pieces
Maximum quantity: 100 pieces
Available stock quantity: 6 pieces
The system does not react.
If an inventory correction (inventory) is made and the available stock falls below the minimum
quantity of 5 pieces, the application intervenes to correct the inventory. Thus, a request is
generated. Such a requirement must be released manually in order for the inventory to reach the
maximum level again. In this example 99 pieces.
If at the same time a large number of work order reservations remain open in the system, they are
deducted in advance from the available stock.
Description method „Reorder level“
The “Reorder Level” method replenishes the inventory
based on a specified reorder and order quantity. If the
available quantity of a storage part reaches or exceeds the
reorder quantity, the system orders the part in increments
of the specified order quantity until the stock quantity
reaches a level that is greater than the reorder quantity.
The maximum quantity is read-only if the storage method
is set to reorder level

First example:
Stock method reorder level
Reorder level: 5 pieces
Order Quantity: 1 piece
As soon as the available storage quantity falls on or below 5 pieces, the system intervenes. If the
available stock is 5 pieces, then the next request generates 1 piece more, so 1 piece is requested.
Second example:
Stock method reorder level
Reorder level: 5 pieces
Order Quantity: 1 piece
As soon as the available storage quantity falls on or below 5 pieces, the system intervenes.
If the available stock is 3 pieces, then the difference to the minimum quantity (5 pieces) and 1
additional piece are requested. This means 3 pieces are requested at the next request generation.
Third example:
Stock method reorder level
Reorder level: 5 pieces
Available stock quantity: 6 pieces
Order Quantity: 1 piece
In this case the system does not react. Only if there are reservations (explained below), the system
begins to intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 2 pieces
The request generation takes into account:
6 parts in stock -> 2 parts needed. Stock falls below 5 parts. This means that there are only 4 parts
left in stock. This automatically triggers the request to fill the warehouse to 1 piece more than the
reorder quantity of 5 pieces. Thus, 2 parts are requested
Description of „On demand“
Choose the Stock Method "On Demand" to replenish low inventory only when there is a need due
to a work order or a stock-to-stock request. The system orders exactly the quantity to cover the
demand, except there is a value entered in the Order Quantity field, than the value is taken into
account.
Reorder level and maximum quantity are read-only when the stocking method is set to On
Demand.
Needed Information’s for On demand:

First Example:
Stock method „On demand“
The system does not react.
Second Example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 7 pieces
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the stock and requests an additional piece to cover the
reservation.
Third Example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
Order quantity: 10 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 7 pieces
The system takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this case
10 pieces.
Fourth example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
Order quantity: 10 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 11 pieces
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this
case 10 pieces.
Fifth example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
Order quantity: 10 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 17 pieces
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this
case 10 pieces.

The inventory shortages are ordered through the four steps from „Generate Requestisition” to
Approve „Purchase Orders”.
 Generate Requisition:
This function determines all parts which have to be reordered and after this
requirements could be generated. This function is usually used by the employee
from the warehouse. He now has the ability to check these parts in the warehouse, if
they really need to be reordered.

 Accept requisition:
After accepting the Requisitions, the parts are released for ordering. This function is
usually carried out by the team leader or logistics manager.
 Create Purchase Order:
In this step is the purchase taking over the parts which have to be ordered. The
orders can be generated automatically.
 Accept Purchase Order:
After the order has been detailed, it can be transmitted to the supplier.
The transfer between warehouse, logistics and purchasing functions can be checked by using the
overview "List of Outstanding Requisition Items". If there is not the same person responsible for the
warehouse and the purchasing, it is advisable to have this list sent automatically by email every
week.
A check on whether the supplier has confirmed the order can be made via a status extension. After
"approved", the status can be set to "confirmed". The check of whether ordered goods have not
arrived yet can be checked via the overview "Approved POs Awaiting Delivery". If appropriate, it is
advisable to have this list sent to you by e-mail on a weekly basis.
Once the material has arrived, the parts are accepted under PO Receipt and assigned to the
correct bin in the store. By approval of the parts they are effectively booked to the store. After this
the invoice voucher for the purchase can be created. In this step the data from the invoice is
entered into the system to update the base data.

2 Introduction
Define initial purchasing information before using the Purchase Management module.
3 Set up
3.1 Defining purchase order terms
Define purchase order terms to use in purchase order activities. Various suppliers might have different
types of purchase terms. The system has five predefined types of purchase order terms. You can also
edit purchase order terms as necessary.
For example, select Freight Terms as the type for an individual purchase order term. This purchase
order term appears in the Freight Terms lookup on the Suppliers form. Set up the individual codes for
each of these types of order terms:
 FOB (Free On Board) point (FOB)– Define where to take possession of an item such as a
receiving dock.
 Freight terms (FRTR)– Establish how different freight charges are paid and who pays them.
 Payment terms (PAY)– Specify how a supplier is paid for a purchase such as COD.
 Payment method (PYMT)– Specify what method is used to pay the supplier.
 Ship via (SHIP)– Define how the supplier ships an item such as overnight, regular mail, etc.

Use the Menu item  „Approve All Parts“ to book the goods receipt over all parts.
It is also possible to book every part individually by using „Approve Part“.
If not all parts are included in the delivery, individual lines can be canceled by using „Cancle Line“.
This symbol ( ) is to print the goods receipt note.
Missing parts from a previous delivery are treated the same way as a new delivery.
Thus the goods receipt is finished.

Einleitung
This document summarizes the typical storage activities. In addition to material handling, material
planning is also a core element. Material planning covers two main areas:
• Stock tracking (storage methods)
• Planning parts for an activity (on a work order)
Inventory tracking is monitoring by using three methods:
 On demand (manual monitoring)
 Reorder Level (as soon as the reorder level is reached or undershot)
 Min/Max (as soon as the minimum quantity is reached, the quantity maximum is increased
to the maximum)
This is in the master data of materials (Materials  Parts  STORES) defined.
The planning of parts for a certain activity is done via the Work Order. As soon as an activity
comes up (for example a revision), a new work order is generated with the corresponding
"Scheduled Start Date". The parts are marked accordingly with a "Reservation" or "Scheduled". To
simplify repeating activities, these parts can be included in a material list. A work order can be
opened on a vehicle and adapt the corresponding standard work order. So all parts are booked or
reserved according to the material list.
Menu paths from the SRMS turn green and the tabs YELLOW marked.

1. Inventory Tracking
1.1. Set up stock methods
Definition of the stock methods
The stock methods are defined under Materials  Parts  Stores. Every
Stock item which has to be monitored must be assigned to a stock method ("On Demand", "Min /
Max" or "Reorder level"). The quantities (reorder level, order quantity, minimum quantity and
maximum quantity) and a preferred supplier is needed.
1.2. Stock methods „On Demand“ , „Min/Max“ and „Reorder level“
Overview
When does a material requirement arise?
 From the stock method „Min/Max“
 From the stock method „Reorder level“
 Material reservations on work orders
A material requirement of the store occurs, if the stock method is set to "Min / Max" or
"Reorder Level".
Seite 5/20
Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
This minimum stock monitoring or reordering monitoring is seen from the perspective of the
stock data record. With the determination of the warehouse and the preferred supplier, a
request is generated as soon as the system determines that the stock level falls below the
specified value.
Description Min/Max
The "Min / Max" method is chosen to maintain inventory based on a given minimum and
maximum amount of resources. When the quantity of a storage part reaches a level lower
than the specified minimum quantity, the system orders the required quantity of the part so
that the stock quantity rises again to the specified maximum quantity.
First Example:
Stock method Min/Max
Minimum quantity : 5 pieces
Maximum quantity: 100 pieces
As soon as the available stock quantity drops below 5 pieces, this is recognized by the application
(Infor EAM) and at the next request compensates the difference to the specified maximum stock
quantity by a corresponding request (order).
(Stock 3, maximum quantity 100, purchase order 97)
Such a stocking request may include either a single part or the inventory of an entire warehouse,
depending on what has been defined.
Second Example:
Stock method Min/Max
Minimum quantity : 5 pieces
Maximum quantity: 100 pieces
Available stock quantity: 6 pieces
The system does not react because none oft he given parameters are affected, but when
reservations for parts are made in work orders (see lines below) requests are generated as well.
Reserved parts in work order: 2 pieces
The requisitons generation takes into account:
6 parts in stock  2 parts needed. The stock value falls under the minimum quantity of 5 parts.
This means that there are only 4 parts left in stock. This automatically triggers the request in the
Infor EAM application that the warehouse has to be increased to 100 units again. Thus, a request
(order) with the difference stock of 96 pieces is generated from the application.
Seite 6/20
Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
Third example:
Stock method Min/Max
Minimum quantity : 5 pieces
Maximum quantity: 100 pieces
Available stock quantity: 6 pieces
The system does not react.
If an inventory correction (inventory) is made and the available stock falls below the minimum
quantity of 5 pieces, the application intervenes to correct the inventory. Thus, a request is
generated. Such a requirement must be released manually in order for the inventory to reach the
maximum level again. In this example 99 pieces.
If at the same time a large number of work order reservations remain open in the system, they are
deducted in advance from the available stock.
The calculation works according to the following scheme:
Difference to minimum stock:
Minimum stock - available stock
Difference to minimum stock <minimum stock => quantity requested = maximum quantity -
available stock
If at the same time a large number of work order reservations remain open in the system,
they are deducted in advance from the available stock.
Description „Reorder level“
The “Reorder Level” method replenishes the inventory based on a specified reorder and
order quantity. If the available quantity of a storage part reaches or exceeds the reorder
quantity, the system orders the part in increments of the specified order quantity until the
stock quantity reaches a level that is greater than the reorder quantity.
The maximum quantity is read-only if the storage method is set to reorder level
First example:
Stock method reorder level
Reorder level: 5 pieces
Order Quantity: 1 piece
As soon as the available storage quantity falls on or below 5 pieces, the system intervenes. If the
available stock is 5 pieces, then the next request generates 1 piece more, so 1 piece is requested.
Second example:
Stock method reorder level
Reorder level: 5 pieces
Order Quantity: 1 piece
As soon as the available storage quantity falls on or below 5 pieces, the system intervenes.
If the available stock is 3 pieces, then the difference to the minimum quantity (5 pieces) and 1
additional piece are requested. This means 3 pieces are requested at the next request generation.

Third example:
Stock method reorder level
Reorder level: 5 pieces
Available stock quantity: 6 pieces
Order Quantity: 1 piece
In this case the system does not react. Only if there are reservations (explained below), the system
begins to intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 2 pieces
The request generation takes into account:
6 parts in stock -> 2 parts needed. Stock falls below 5 parts. This means that there are only 4 parts
left in stock. This automatically triggers the request to fill the warehouse to 1 piece more than the
reorder quantity of 5 pieces. Thus, 2 parts are requested
Description of „On demand“
Choose the Stock Method "On Demand" to replenish low inventory only when there is a need due
to a work order or a stock-to-stock request. The system orders exactly the quantity to cover the
demand, except there is a value entered in the Order Quantity field, than the value is taken into
account.
Reorder level and maximum quantity are read-only when the stocking method is set to On
Demand.
First Example:
Stock method „On demand“
The system does not react.
Second Example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 7 pieces
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the stock and requests an additional piece to cover the
reservation.
Third Example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
Order quantity: 10 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 7 pieces
The system takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this case
10 pieces.

Fourth example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
Order quantity: 10 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 11 pieces
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this
case 10 pieces.
Fifth example:
Stock method „On demand“
Available stock: 6 pieces
Order quantity: 10 pieces
At this point the system does not react. Only with reservations (see below), the system begins to
intervene.
Reserved parts in the work order: 17 pieces
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this
case 10 pieces.
The system first takes the 6 pieces from the warehouse and then requests in 10-steps, so in this
case 20 pieces.
Overview stock methods
An overview of the parts and their assigned stock methods is provided by the "Stock standard" list.
This creates a list about which storage methods are used for the different parts.

1.3. Inventory monitoring
Process Inventory monitoring
The inventory shortages are ordered through the four steps from „Generate Requestisition” to
Approve „Purchase Orders”.
 Generate Requisition:
This function determines all parts which have to be reordered and after this
requirements could be generated. This function is usually used by the employee
from the warehouse. He now has the ability to check these parts in the warehouse, if
they really need to be reordered.
 Accept requisition:
After accepting the Requisitions, the parts are released for ordering. This function is
usually carried out by the team leader or logistics manager.
 Create Purchase Order:
In this step is the purchase taking over the parts which have to be ordered. The
orders can be generated automatically.
 Accept Purchase Order:
After the order has been detailed, it can be transmitted to the supplier.
The transfer between warehouse, logistics and purchasing functions can be checked by using the
overview Materials  Reports "List of Outstanding Requisition Items". If there is not the same
person responsible for the warehouse and the purchasing, it is advisable to have this list sent
automatically by email every week.
A check on whether the supplier has confirmed the order can be made via a status extension. After
"approved", the status can be set to "confirmed".
The check of whether ordered goods have not arrived yet can be checked via Purchasing 
Reports  „ Approved POs Awaiting Delivery “ + or . ". If appropriate, it is advisable to have
this list sent to you by e-mail on a weekly basis.

Once the material has arrived, the parts are accepted under PO Receipt and assigned to the
correct bin in the store ( Materials  Transactions  PO Receipts). By approval of the parts they
are effectively booked to the store. After this, the invoice voucher ( Purchasing Invoice Voucher)
for the purchase can be created. In this step the data from the invoice is entered into the system to
update the base data.

3.2 Compare the Transactions with the Store Inventory Report
This Report is used to compare all transactions which were made during the last month with the
Store Inventory of the previous month and the Store Inventory of the actual month. The total

2 Processes
In particular the Issue/Return parts and the Non-PO receipt transfer are used to move parts between two
stores which are NOT in the same Organization and parts which are NOT in the Organization *. In this
Document the Issue/Return parts and the Non-PO receipt transfer are used to move parts between the two
stores Marghera and Bologna.
To do the transfers, there is not much preparation needed. You must have a valid part data set in both
organizations, a store in each organization and a quantity on stock which you want to transfer.
Materials  Parts  STOCK
Do the Issue/Return parts process to issue the parts out of
the store
Request is done via mail or phone
Create the part in the organization where you want to
return the parts, if they do not already exist
Parts are delivered physically to the other store
End transaction
Do a Non-PO Receipt to book the parts to the store of the
other Organization. Do NOT do the return process of the
Issue/Return Parts process because then the price will not
be updated

2 Introduction
Set up initial equipment information before using the equipment module.
2.1 Understanding equipment
Pieces of equipment are entities for which you store data and create work orders. Equipment can
be of many different types, but the four main types are locations, systems, positions, and assets.
 Locations – Physical locations of systems, positions, and assets. For example, a pumping
system is located in Room 104.
 Systemes – Collections of positions and/or assets that work together so that when one part
goes down, all parts are affected. For example, if a pump stops working, you must turn off
the entire water line to repair it.
 Positions – Functions performed by a general kind of asset. For example, the pump that
moves water from one tank to another is a functional position, which can be filled by any
number of actual, physical pumps (assets). Positions are also called "functional positions."
 Assets– Generally, physical objects. Assets are the base unit of equipment information and
the smallest tracking unit for capital investments.
Locations, systems, positions, and assets form a hierarchy of equipment information, with locations
at the top of the hierarchy and assets at the bottom. Data is shared among the levels of the
equipment hierarchy. For example, data for a work order performed on an asset is also stored in
the position, system, and location equipment to which the asset belongs. This data sharing allows
you to track assets and their performance in detail and under differing conditions, to evaluate the
performance of entire systems, and to assess the effect that locations and positions have on
systems and assets.
For example, you might have a pump (PU-9476-96) working in a functional position (PUMP-03) in
a system on the first floor (FLOOR-01). The pump fails, and you remove it from the system to
repair it and place another pump (PU-4854-93) in that position. The work order data for the failed
pump is stored not only with the pump equipment (PU-9476-96) but also with the position
equipment (PUMP-03) and the location equipment (FLOOR-01). When the pump is repaired, you
place it in a different functional position (PUMP-02) on the second floor (FLOOR-02). After the
pump is in that position for a while, you can compare the following:
 the performance of PU-9476-96 to the performance of PU-4854-93 in position PUMP-03 in
location FLOOR-01 and
 the performance of PU-9476-96 in position PUMP-03 at location FLOOR-01 to its
performance in position PUMP-02 at location FLOOR-02.

3 Setting up equipment categories
3.1 Objektkategorien einrichten
Categories provide a way to further organize pieces of equipment. For example, if a class is
defined for motors, create a category for motor types and sizes.
Note: If you created custom attributes for equipment classes, those attributes roll down to the
category level and are visible in the Custom Fields section of the Record View page.
To set up equipment categories:
1. Select Equipment > Setup > Categories.
2. Click New Record.
3. Specify this information:
4. Category - Specify a unique code identifying the category, and then specify a description of
the category in the adjacent field.
5. Specify the Equipment Class and Manufacturer.
6. Click Save Record.
3.2 Setting up closing codes
The system contains four types of closing codes: action codes, cause codes, failure codes, and
problem codes. Action codes describe the steps necessary to correct the problem. For example, a
code can specify to add lubricant to a pump. Cause codes identify what caused the component or
type of component to fail, in other words the root cause of the problem. Failure codes identify the
reason the equipment failed. Finally, problem codes identify the observed equipment failure, such
as a leak from a faucet or the overheating of a pump.
To set up closing codes:
1. Select Equipment > Setup > Closing Codes.
2. Click New Record.
3. Specify the Closing Code, Type, and Group.
The closing code will display in a tree of closing codes in lookups grouped by selected type
4. Select the Out of Service check box to mark the closing code out of service so that the
closing code will not display in lookups.
5. Select the Valid for all Equipment Classes check box to make the closing code available
to associate with any equipment regardless of the class defined for the equipment. General
closing codes apply to general terms.
Note: If classes have been created for the closing code, you cannot select General.

Stadler Service AG CH-9565 Bussnang Tel +41 (0)71 626 20 20 Fax +41 (0)71 626 20 21 www.stadlerrail.com
6. Select the Enable for Work Orders check box to display closing codes for work orders.
7. Select the Enable for Part Failures check box to display this closing code for part failures.
8. Click Save Record
3.2.1 Associating closing codes with classes
Associate closing codes with classes. For example, equipment with a class of HVAC can have
different closing codes than equipment with a class of MOTOR. A closing code can be associated
with multiple classes.
Note: You cannot associate classes with general closing codes.
To associate closing codes with classes:
1. Select Equipment > Setup > Closing Codes.
2. Select the closing code with which to associate classes, and then click the Classes tab.
3. Click Add Class.
4. Specify the Class to associate with the closing code. The system automatically populates
the class description and Class Org.
5. Click Submit
3.2.2 Defining closing code hierarchies
Define parent/child hierarchy details for closing codes.
To define closing code hierarchies:
1. Select Equipment > Setup > Closing Code Hierarchy
2. Click Add Relationship
3. Specify the Parent Closing Code, Child Closing Code, and Equipment.
4. Click Submit
3.3 Setting up departments
A department is the center or area that is responsible for the maintenance of equipment, such as
an asset, a position, a system, or a location. The department coordinates the work, assigns the
appropriate crew, plans the work, and approves respective work orders.
When defining equipment, assign it to a department. The department can be modified if needed on
work orders. When creating work orders for maintenance or repairs to equipment, the system rolls
up the associated costs to the department of the work order. Set up a default store for each
department as well as a default supervisor. When reserving parts for a work order, the system
stores them in the specified store.
Note: You cannot delete departments if they have already been used elsewhere in the system.
To set up departments:

Click on to open the substructure step by step.
Now check whether the old Asset (Pantograph) has been removed from the structure and the new asset has
been taken over.
In our example, the part 12153069 was exchanged.
The Asset ID of the removed part is 160730041 and that of the built-in 160730031.
Therefore, open the system in which the asset has been replaced, in our example, in wagon C.
Now search in the structure of the system in which the pantograph is installed.
The structure shows the Asset (A) 160730031 with SN: 2699
This is the same asset ID like the one that was installed in section "3.2 Install Asset/ Equipment".

2 Initial Situation
The process is described step by step by using an example.
As an example, a LDG is as a replacement asset in the store. In it there are various
subcomponents installed. In the example, the subcomponent speed sensor is replaced with a
replacement speed sensor.
Replacement assets with status „In store“ (Example Running Bogie).
Structure (Child Equipment) of the replacement asset. All sub-components also have the status in
store

Built-in sub-components in the replacement asset which have to be replaced (status in store, same
store as replacement asset).
Replacement components, which should be installed during the replacement (status in store, are
independent of the replacement asset).

3 Work order and issue parts
To replace the child equipment, which is built-in in the replacement asset, a work order has to be
generated and the replacement asset (With all sub components) issued from the store. As
Equipment for this work order, the replacement asset has to be chosen. Furthermore, the time
required for the replacement can be booked to the work order.
Work Order: Replace the speed sensor on the LDG “In Store” with activities
In the tab "Parts", the replacement asset is issued (in this case, the entire running bogie). For the
issue, the corresponding Bin and the corresponding Asset ID must be selected.

5 Work Order and Part return
After the child equipments in the replacement asset are replaced, it is possible to return it to the
store. Therefore the same work order as in point 3 is used.
In the tab „Parts“ the replacement asset is via the transaction type „return“ returned to the store (In
this case the whole running bogie). In the returning process, the correct store and the correct asset
ID have to be selected.
Then the time for the exchange can be booked to the work order and the work order can be closed.
6 Result
The replacement asset with the replaced subcomponent is back in the store. Depending on the
selection, the removed subcomponent is located in the process of subobject exchange in the
warehouse, in the warehouse for repair, or as a reject with the status withdrawn.
